# Money with friends (Argent entre amis)  

School project to create an Android application.

Not a clean project, it's just for learn more about Android Studio coding. In this application I use Bluetooth between two devices 
to update their informations. I use "Shared Preference" too to save data on the device.

Find what I did in "moneywithfriends/app/src/main/java/com/example/passe/".
